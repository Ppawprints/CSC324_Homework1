	  <p1><br>Thank you for visiting my website!
	    <br><br> A little about me:
	    <br>I am a third-year Computer Science and French major at Grinnell College, and this website is an individual project for a class I took in spring 2020, CSC 324: Software Development and Design.
	    <br><br>About my website:
	    <br>This site contains a consistent header, footer. The color scheme as well as fonts are carefully chosen to be consistent with the style of the website, all of which demonstrates my front-end development skills â€“ the use of HTML and CSS. The site provides login / signup functionalities, and provides exclusive contents for users with an account. The user information is stored in a database, while the sensitive information is kept secure and away from the developer, demonstrating my ability with databases using Ruby on Rails. Upon signup, each user is paired with a pet matching their preferences. Users that are logged in also have access randomized pet images, showingmy ability to write basic Ruby code.
