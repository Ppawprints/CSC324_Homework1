	<p1><br>Cats Tend to Be Clean Animals: cats spend much of their time grooming themselves, so you will rarely have to bathe your feline friend. Compared to dogs, cats tend to smell much better. Unlike dogs, your cat won’t go outside and roll in unpleasant things or pick a fight with a skunk. Because cats are so good at keeping themselves clean, they usually feel softer and cleaner than dogs and many other animals when you pet them.
	  <br><br>Cats Are Quiet: even the loudest, most insistent meows are much quieter than most barks. Even when your cat is trying her hardest to annoy you into giving her extra treats, her meow sounds are adorable. You will never have neighbors complaining about your cat meowing too much. It’s hard to be annoyed by such cute little sounds.
