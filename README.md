### About
This is a repo containing Yilan's first website. It contains pictures of cute animals. 
Last updated for Protfolio.

This site contains a consistent header, footer. The color scheme as well as fonts are carefully chosen to be consistent with the style of the website, all of which demonstrates my front-end development skills â€“ the use of HTML and CSS. The site provides login / signup functionalities, and provides exclusive contents for users with an account. The user information is stored in a database, while the sensitive information is kept secure and away from the developer, demonstrating my ability with databases using Ruby on Rails. Upon signup, each user is paired with a pet matching their preferences. Users that are logged in also have access randomized pet images, showing my ability to write basic Ruby code.
